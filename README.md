# Allocators
This repo is based on Andrei Alexandrescu CppCon 2015 speech [std::allocator Is to Allocation what std::vector Is to Vexation](https://www.google.ru/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CBsQtwIwAGoVChMI2pi4h4PWyAIVCX8sCh0MGQVx&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DLIb3L4vKZ7U&usg=AFQjCNFmeyekmwsPWF_SLMa3V8hDkXhl9g&sig2=9w08WYkc1esooxdJb4kU3A&bvm=bv.105814755,d.bGg) which, itself is probably based on [Dlang's std_allocator ](https://github.com/andralex/std_allocator)

This project is WIP and probably contains brutal errors
